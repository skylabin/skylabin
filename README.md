- 👋 Hi, I’m @skylabin
- 👀 I’m interested in Raspberry PI use in schools. Build a community lab like Dominique did in Togo.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and how to introduce R for learning Mathematics in schools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NeoVIM-R so that I can manage R without RStudio. Failed to install Rstudio in Pi.
- 📫 You can reach me at edupi4in@gmail.com and I will post on my site http://edupi.in
